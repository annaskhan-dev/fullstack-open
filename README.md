🚀 Project Summary

Throughout these exercises, the goal was to build and improve the Course Information app step by step. The tasks included:

- Initializing a new React application using **Vite**
- Displaying the course name and its parts
- Structuring the UI into small, reusable React components
- Passing data to components using **props**
- Creating and using the following components:
  - **Header** – displays the course name  
  - **Content** – renders all course parts  
  - **Part** – shows a single part with its exercise count  
  - **Total** – calculates and displays the total number of exercises  

These exercises focus on understanding the basics of React, including components, props, and clean code structure.
